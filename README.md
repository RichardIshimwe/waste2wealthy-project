<h1 style="color:blue">Waste2wealthy project</h1>
<p>The Waste2wealth Project is an innovative idea aimed at addressing the pressing challenges of waste management and 
energy sustainability by using the potential of organic waste to generate clean electricity </p>
<p>With the increase in population and economic activities, there is an ever-growing demand for energy (electricity).Over 
the years, advancements in biogas technology have showcased its potential in waste management and renewable energy 
production
<p>

<p>This project came to our minds as there was a shortage of energy and as a result we took a look in our surroundings and 
we found that we can use the available resources like waste and gain something valuable in return which is electricity 
that we were in need of.</p>
